will do:

    -   Implement terrain generation based on the pixels in .bmp files
        Each pixel colors determine what type will be generated in a coresponding world area.
        Basic terrain generation should contain one color for standard landmass and one for water.

    -   Create a 2d grid of vertexes where quads are drawn from, each vertex position should be moved around
        semi-randomly to create primitive water animation. 
        The color of each vertex should normaly be blue unless its spawned within or on the edge of a landmass, in which case it should be white.

    -   Create a player model that can move around on suitable terrain, collosion detection with
        terrain should primary be done using .bmp files

    -   The Camera should be placed above the player, it should be looking at the player and it should be sligthly tiled.

    -   Implement a main menu which allows the user to start a game.


might do:

    -   Enhance terrain generation. Add more terrain types.

    -   Water reflections and/or make the landmass cast shadows on the water. (not in real time)

    -   Animate the player model.
    
    -   Add visual effects such as dust when walking.

    -   Hold middle mouse button to move the position of the camera around the player.
        When realesed the camera should return to its original position.
